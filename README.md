Citation-Generator
==================
Jordan 

One Author.js allows a user to enter a book's information, 
which then creates an American Psychological Assosciation (APA) style citation.
The citation is an html string literal which can then used by the user. 

One Author.html is an example implementation of the javascript file.

Currently One Author is the file that supports a citation for a single author book.
Plans for future implementation of other document types.
